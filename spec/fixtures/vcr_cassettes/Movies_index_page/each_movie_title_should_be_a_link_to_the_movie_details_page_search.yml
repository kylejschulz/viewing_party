        man shoots six people in a park, seemingly at random. The evidence is obvious
        and the police catch him short after. When asked about the murders, all he
        says (or rather writes) is \"Get Jack Reacher\". They do, and while Jack thinks
        he is only here to bury him (whatever that actually means), he soon finds
        out that the rabbit hole goes a bit further than he originally thought. Now
        Jack is looking to put together the pieces of a much larger puzzle.\r\n\r\nThis
        movie has the ring of a simple action movie with a small twist. The twist,
        actually, is quite obvious if you think about what is happening in the beginning
        of the movie.\r\n\r\nI remember seeing the trailer a long time ago, and it
        painted a picture of a comedy, but this movie is not that. It might have one
        or two funny fight scenes (and dialogue with Robert Duvall), but it is actually
        quite dark. This is kinda what saved the movie a bit for me, having judged
        it beforehand.\r\n\r\nTom Cruise is... Tom Cruise. At least in the way that
        we have seen him protrayed in the most recent years. The silent, cool guy
        who knows how to handle the problems, and who seems to always be one step
        ahead of everyone. I am not a big fan of this guy, and therefore, ultimately,
        not a big fan of Jack Reacher, however, it is slightly better than I thought
        it would be. And Werner Herzog has a nice little cameo, that movie aficionados
        will surely enjoy, being the great director that he is.\r\n\r\n_Last words...
        if you like Tom Cruise, go for it. If you like a nice organized action movie,
        much like the many Bourne movies... go for it. If you want more than superficial
        characters and a very straightforward plot, this is not the movie for you._","created_at":"2014-12-26T22:34:26.570Z","id":"549de27292514131320065ea","updated_at":"2014-12-27T01:20:25.021Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/549de27292514131320065ea"},{"author":"John

        think I''m a hero? I am not a hero. And if you''re smart, that scares you.
        Because I have nothing to lose.\r\n\r\nIt got off on the wrong foot, fans
        of the Lee Child novels were up in arms about the casting of Tom Cruise in
        the title role. He didn''t fit the profile it was said, scorn was poured on
        the film, quite often by people who hadn''t even seen it! So how refreshing
        to find that since I personally have no affinity to the Child books, and having
        never read anything by the author, I found a wonderfully old fashioned thriller.\r\n\r\nReacher
        the character is a damn fine creation, an ex military bad ass who doesn''t
        get found unless he wants to get found. He gets involved with jobs that need
        solving, utilising his special skills to close out the mysteries. Here he
        pitches up along side defence attorney Helen Rodin (Rosamund Pike) when an
        ex army sniper apparently at random kills five people and then mentions Reacher''s
        name during interrogation. Cue twists and turns, rocks upturned for covert
        clues and a shady road to be trawled to get to the crux of the matter.\r\n\r\nCruise
        as Reacher is superb, where under the astute directing and writing of Christopher
        McQuarrie we are left in no doubt this is a cool no nonsense hard man, loved
        by the ladies and feared by not just the crims, but also the law authorities.
        None of which is overkilled, it''s subtle in execution, McQuarrie doesn''t
        need to turn his film into a blitzkrieg of CGI blunderbuss multiplex pandering.
        Action is smartly staged, the violence brutal without being course, while
        the story is delightful in how it gleefully wrong foots the viewers in plot
        dynamics and sly humour.\r\n\r\nThe deal is closed out via the sterling supporting
        turns to Cruise, with Pike, Robert Duvall, Werner Herzog and Jai Courtney
        adding considerably to this splendid Cruise and McQuarrie broth. In spite
        of divisive reviews and reports, Jack Reacher in filmic form has risen above
        that to become a success. Hooray! 7.5/10","created_at":"2018-12-16T11:00:12.185Z","id":"5c16303c0e0a2641003b77e7","updated_at":"2018-12-19T17:48:36.469Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/5c16303c0e0a2641003b77e7"}],"total_pages":1,"total_results":2}'
